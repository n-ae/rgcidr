# Benchmarking Guide

This document describes how to benchmark rgcidr against the official grepcidr implementation and analyze performance.

## Official grepcidr Source

The benchmarks compare against the **original grepcidr 2.0** by Jem Berkes:
- **Official Website**: https://www.pc-tools.net/unix/grepcidr/
- **Source Archive**: https://www.pc-tools.net/files/unix/grepcidr-2.0.tar.gz
- **Version**: 2.0 (released 2014-05-26)
- **License**: GNU GPL
- **Author**: Jem Berkes

Note: This is the original implementation. There is also a fork by John Levine, but our benchmarks use the official source from pc-tools.net.

## Quick Start

### Run Official Benchmark

The easiest way to benchmark against the official grepcidr:

```bash
# Run comprehensive benchmark (fetches and builds grepcidr automatically)
lua scripts/benchmark_official.lua
```

This script will:
1. Download the official grepcidr 2.0 from pc-tools.net
2. Build it with optimizations (-O3)
3. Build rgcidr with ReleaseFast
4. Run all tests with multiple iterations
5. Generate detailed performance report and CSV output

### Manual grepcidr Management

You can also manage the official grepcidr separately:

```bash
# Show information about grepcidr source
lua scripts/fetch_grepcidr.lua info

# Get path to grepcidr binary (builds if needed)
GREPCIDR_PATH=$(lua scripts/fetch_grepcidr.lua get)

# Clean up temporary files
lua scripts/fetch_grepcidr.lua clean
```

## Benchmark Types

### 1. Basic Benchmarks

```bash
# Simple performance test
zig build bench

# Advanced benchmarks with larger datasets
zig build bench-advanced
```

### 2. Official Comparison

```bash
# Compare against official grepcidr 2.0
lua scripts/benchmark_official.lua
```

Output includes:
- Summary statistics (win rates, overall speedup)
- Detailed per-test results
- Performance category analysis
- CSV file (`benchmark_official.csv`)

### 3. Regression Testing

```bash
# Compare current branch against main
zig build bench-regression

# Compare against specific branch
lua scripts/bench_regression.lua develop

# Generate CSV for CI/CD
lua scripts/bench_regression.lua main --csv
```

## Understanding Results

### Performance Metrics

- **Mean Time**: Average execution time across iterations
- **Min/Max Time**: Best and worst case performance
- **Speedup Factor**: Ratio of grepcidr time to rgcidr time
  - `> 1.0`: rgcidr is faster
  - `< 1.0`: grepcidr is faster
  - `â‰ˆ 1.0`: Similar performance

### Performance Categories

- **Excellent** (>1.5x): rgcidr significantly faster
- **Good** (1.1-1.5x): rgcidr moderately faster
- **Comparable** (0.9-1.1x): Similar performance
- **Slower** (0.5-0.9x): grepcidr moderately faster
- **Poor** (<0.5x): grepcidr significantly faster

### Key Files

Generated outputs:
- `benchmark_official.csv`: Detailed results in CSV format
- `benchmark_results.csv`: Simple benchmark results
- `benchmark_comprehensive.csv`: Full test suite results

## Building for Benchmarks

### Optimization Levels

Always use `ReleaseFast` for benchmarking:

```bash
# Optimal for benchmarking
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast

# Other options (not recommended for benchmarks)
zig build -Doptimize=Debug        # Development only
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe  # With safety checks
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSmall # Size optimization
```

### Official grepcidr Build

The fetch script builds grepcidr with:
- `-O3` optimization (maximum performance)
- Standard C compiler (gcc/clang)
- No debug symbols

## Test Data

### Test Structure

Tests are located in `tests/` with three components:
- `*.given`: Input data file
- `*.action`: Command-line arguments
- `*.expected`: Expected output

### Benchmark Tests

Large-scale performance tests:
- `bench_ipv6_large`: Large IPv6 dataset
- `bench_large_dataset`: Large mixed IP dataset  
- `bench_multiple_patterns`: Multiple CIDR patterns
- `bench_count_large`: Count mode with large file

### Creating Custom Benchmarks

1. Create a large input file:
```bash
# Generate test data
cat > tests/custom_bench.given <<EOF
192.168.1.1
10.0.0.1
172.16.0.1
# ... more IPs
EOF
```

2. Create action file:
```bash
echo "192.168.0.0/16" > tests/custom_bench.action
```

3. Run benchmark:
```bash
lua scripts/benchmark_official.lua
```

## Performance Tips

### For rgcidr Development

1. **Always benchmark with ReleaseFast**
2. **Use official grepcidr as baseline**
3. **Test with various data sizes**
4. **Consider both IPv4 and IPv6 performance**

### For Production Use

1. **Build with ReleaseFast for deployment**
2. **Consider memory vs speed tradeoffs**
3. **Profile specific use cases**
4. **Monitor regression between releases**

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Cannot download grepcidr:**
- Check internet connection
- Try manual download from https://www.pc-tools.net/files/unix/grepcidr-2.0.tar.gz
- Verify curl is installed

**Build failures:**
- Ensure gcc/clang is installed
- Check make is available
- Verify Zig 0.15.1+ for rgcidr

**Inconsistent results:**
- Close other applications
- Run multiple iterations
- Use consistent optimization levels
- Ensure thermal throttling isn't occurring

### Manual Benchmark

For custom testing:

```bash
# Build both tools
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
cd /tmp && curl -L -O https://www.pc-tools.net/files/unix/grepcidr-2.0.tar.gz
tar xzf grepcidr-2.0.tar.gz && cd grepcidr-2.0
make CFLAGS='-O3'

# Compare performance
time /tmp/grepcidr-2.0/grepcidr "192.168.0.0/16" large_file.txt
time ./zig-out/bin/rgcidr "192.168.0.0/16" large_file.txt
```

## Contributing

When submitting performance improvements:

1. Run official benchmarks before and after changes
2. Include benchmark results in PR description
3. Document any algorithmic changes
4. Ensure no regression in correctness tests
5. Consider impact on both IPv4 and IPv6 performance
